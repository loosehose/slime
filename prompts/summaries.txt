Act as a senior red team engineer with 20 years of offensive security consulting. Write vulnerability reports strictly in JSON format according to the following structure:

I need you to create executive summary, assessment overview, and detailed assessment overview for a red team report based on the following findings. I will also provide some examples.

  "ExecutiveSummary": "Red Team engagements are an important part of a comprehensive security strategy that can help organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities or misconfigurations before they are exploited by attackers. The Standard Industries Red Team conducted an engagement against the EXAMPLE network between April 15, 2024 and April 19, 2024. Real-world adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) were employed through the course of testing against the network to emulate possible threat scenarios. The goal of the exercise was to identify and exploit security weaknesses in the network in order to assess its security posture. The Red Team identified multiple instances of well-designed infrastructure that were challenging to navigate with malicious intent. The Red Team utilized low-privileged credentials to map the Azure environment. During the testing period, there appeared to be no viable attack path to privileged accounts. The Red Team also attempted to install a malicious program, designed to establish a callback to a Command and Control (C2) server, but failed to establish a connection. The firewall configuration successfully blocked attempts at foreign outbound connections. Key Findings: The Red Team discovered various vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that may be exploited by a threat actor if left unmitigated. The following list is a brief summary of those findings, which include two (2) Critical, two (2) High and five (5) Medium findings. More details are provided in Section 4 of this report. A high-level overview of noteworthy findings follows. The Active Directory group, AUTHENTICATED USERS, in some instances, possessed risky permissions across the CORP.EXAMPLE.COM environment. The Red Team was able to impersonate any user in Active Directory with any set of permissions to gain access to sensitive data or further traverse the network by abusing misconfigured Active Directory Certificate Services templates. Domain Users are granted Local Administrator rights on two CORP.EXAMPLE.COM workstations. This configuration allows any Domain User to execute commands with administrative privileges. Three Oracle WebLogic Servers were discovered to be vulnerable to remote code execution. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker on the network to potentially compromise the server, elevate privileges, and move laterally within the network. The Red Team employed social engineering against the help desk, over a phone call, to access a malicious website designed to simulate a browser takeover, demonstrating how an external attacker could gain an initial foothold to the network. Two instances of Oracle WebLogic were found running as SYSTEM users, which has the highest level of privileges on a Windows system, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the entire system if the application is compromised. One instance of Oracle WebLogic was found running as psftadmin Domain User, which is likely an administrator user of EXAMPLE’s ERP solution PeopleSoft. If the application server is compromised, the attacker could potentially access PeopleSoft systems as an administrator and access sensitive HR and financial information. Identified several network shares containing potentially high-value content and data, such as “Bonus”, “HR”, and “W9” shares are accessible to all Domain Users on the network. Files were found to contain credentials that could be used to attempt logins or generate a password file based on easy passwords. Additionally, RDP files were found which could be used as a pivot to find other servers within the network.",
  
  "AssessmentOverview": "This assessment was conducted using the EXAMPLE VPN to access the internal network under an Assume Breach model. The Red Team utilized EXAMPLE.COM Domain User credentials, which provided low-level, unprivileged access to the network. The objective of this engagement was to identify potential attack paths from either a low-level domain user or an unauthenticated user to high-privilege network objects, including computers and users. The initial two days were dedicated to identifying potential vulnerabilities and attack paths, followed by three days of active exploitation.",
  
  "DetailedAssessmentSummary": "The Red Team identified multiple methods allowing low-level Domain Users to access highly privileged Active Directory objects. The Red Team discovered two distinct ways to obtain domain administrator access and one method for local administrator rights on two workstations. Authenticated Users, using domain-joined credentials, can request the private key of any account, including those of domain administrators. Obtaining this key enables a threat actor to authenticate to a domain controller and capture an NTLM hash. This hash can be used for offline cracking or in Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attacks, where the attacker authenticates to domain-joined objects using the hash instead of the plaintext password, assuming the compromised user has the required access rights. This vulnerability exists because the group CORP.EXAMPLE.COM\\AUTHENTICATED USERS can enroll and set the subject and template for client authentication. Additionally, authenticated users have GenericWrite access to over 13,000 Active Directory objects, including all domain controllers in the CORP.EXAMPLE.COM environment. Threat actors can exploit this by creating a machine account, requesting impersonation to the target machine, retrieving the impersonated service ticket, and conducting Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) authentication attacks. The Red Team tested this scenario and executed a DCSync attack to obtain the NTLM hash of a user. The team also discovered two workstations where Domain Users have Local Administrative privileges. These machines are vulnerable to attacks where adversaries can install malware, execute commands remotely, and engage in other malicious activities. With these privileges, sophisticated threat actors can extract credentials, deploy keyloggers, and maintain a presence on these machines without detection. Although the Red Team accessed sensitive information on these two machines, they found no viable path for lateral movement across the network. The Red Team discovered a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability on an internal WebLogic web server running as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. Given the high privileges of the WebLogic process, threat actors can inject malicious shellcode and perform credential dumping on the machine. Post-exploitation activities such as EDR blinding can occur, effectively disabling security solutions. The Red Team conducted minimal further exploitation on this machine and determined the proof-of-concept (PoC) exemplified the severity of the vulnerability. The Red Team targeted EXAMPLE's help desk in social engineering efforts. The Red Team created a placeholder domain, EXAMPLE.azureadsync.com, which featured instructions on installing Azure in an internal environment. This webpage served as a facade for a malicious domain. The Red Team spoofed a phone number, impersonated a EXAMPLE employee, and requested the help desk access the webpage. If the domain was malicious, the Red Team could gather operating system information, IP address, and potentially 'hook' the browser to conduct post-exploitation activities such as stealing session cookies or remote code execution within the browser."
